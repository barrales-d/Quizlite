# CPSC349 Project 1 - QuizLite!

This project uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and JQuery. 
It is a **simplistic, one-page** application that only uses JavaScript to handle data and logic. 

One clear example of this is the `js/quiz_questions.js` file; instead of having a database and PHP code to get these questions, or more simply a live server to fetch a JSON file, I had to create a JavaScript file that I could load in the index.html using the `script` tag.
