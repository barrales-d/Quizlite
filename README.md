# CPSC349 Project 1 - QuizLite!

This project uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and JQuery. I was unsure if I should use a live server/database because I thought this should be a simple project, so I opted not to use them. However, since I did not use them, this project is a **simplistic, one-page** application that only uses JavaScript to handle data and logic. 

One clear example of this is the `js/quiz_questions.js` file; instead of having a database and PHP code to get these questions, or more simply a live server to fetch a JSON file, I had to create a JavaScript file that I could load in the index.html using the `script` tag.

### Running the project!

To run this project, you can simply open the index.html file in the browser of your choice.
*You should have an internet connection because the Boostrap and JQuery are connected with their corresponding CDNs.*
